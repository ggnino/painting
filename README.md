# A Rothko Painting
This is part of the updated version of the FreeCodeCamp web development course.
<br/>It's objective is to get the user familiar with the CSS box model by building a rothko painting.
<br/> I tried to make a tab bit more realistic with styling the added svg imgs to the actual painting. As if, it was painted and not just a simple colored square.
